# Torch DeepDanbooru

A PyTorch implementation of [DeepDanbooru](https://github.com/KichangKim/DeepDanbooru) and C++ deployment, which will be used in my another project [Waifu Gallery](https://github.com/R4nd5tr/waifu_gallery).

This repository provides PyTorch implementations of the DeepDanbooru model functions and features as well as conversion scripts to convert the original TensorFlow/Keras weights to PyTorch format.
